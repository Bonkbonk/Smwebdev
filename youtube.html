Although YouTube is mainly used for entertainment purposes, it also has a variety
of other uses.

One of those being Education, students can search for video tutorials on how to
complete some of their schoolwork if they’re stuck on a certain aspect.

Similarly, if teachers / professors would like to use a visual element to aid in
explaining a concept to their students are a quick YouTube search away from
finding exactly what they are looking for.

huge YouTube has become and how much content has been uploaded to the
service.

topics you can think of will have users that have created video tutorials on how to
complete certain tasks. Anything you want to know how do, YouTube will most
likely have a video tutorial for it.</p>
